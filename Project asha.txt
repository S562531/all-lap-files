A chatbot is like a digital conversation partner created by computer programs. It's designed to engage with people, typically over the internet, in a way that mimics human conversation. This means it can understand and respond to natural language inputs, allowing users to interact with it as if they were chatting with another person.

These virtual assistants find applications on different platforms such as websites, messaging apps, and voice interfaces. Their purpose is to provide users with information, assistance, or perform specific tasks through a dynamic and conversational interaction. By leveraging artificial intelligence and natural language processing, chatbots aim to make human-computer communication more intuitive and user-friendly.

Pravalika:

Libraries sometimes struggle to help people find information easily. The old-fashioned ways of getting help, like asking a person or looking at static (unchanging) online resources, aren't always quick or helpful. People might have a hard time finding what they need or figuring out how to use library services. To make things better, we need a smart computer program (chatbot) that can talk to people, understand what they're looking for, and provide personalized help in real-time. This way, everyone can have a smoother and more enjoyable experience when using the library.
